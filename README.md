This is a small demo of how to manage keys for an API. This is a simpler alternative to a full OAuth implementation, but just as secure as far as I can tell. Many APIs use key-style authentication, where they issue keys for you that you must store securely yourself. The standard pattern is to show the key only once during initial creation. In fact the raw key is not stored but rather only a hash of it is. Here are the parts of this:

- secure storage via abstract class [ApiKeyManager.cs](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ApiKeys/blob/master/ApiKeys.Service/ApiKeyManager.cs). Implemented in this demo as [SqlLiteApiKeyManager.cs](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ApiKeys/blob/master/ApiKeys.Service/SqliteApiKeyManager.cs). This what one might iterate/expand upon to bundle in specific permissions/roles along with maybe an expiration date. This is a minimal example that does not have expiration dates nor anything else -- just the key.
- an authorization handler [ApiKeyAuthorizationHandler](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ApiKeys/blob/master/ApiKeys.Service/ApiKeyAuthorizationHandler.cs) is what secures your API endpoints.
- a minimal Blazor example for creating and deleting keys: [ApiKeys.razor](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ApiKeys/blob/master/ApiKeys.BlazorApp/Components/Pages/ApiKeys.razor). This will show the key only once, requiring you to copy and store it yourself. Phase 2 functionality would be some kind of key rotation feature.
- sample controller using public and secure endpoints: [DemoController.cs](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ApiKeys/blob/master/ApiKeys.BlazorApp/Controllers/DemoController.cs)
- a minimal testing UI [ApiDemo.razor](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ApiKeys/blob/master/ApiKeys.BlazorApp/Components/Pages/ApiDemo.razor)
